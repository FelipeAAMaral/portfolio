# Testing Accessible Web Applications

Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them effectively. Here's how to make your applications more accessible.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Beyond being the right thing to do, accessibility:

- Improves SEO and reaches more users
- Helps meet legal requirements in many countries
- Creates better experiences for everyone, not just those with disabilities
- Forces cleaner, better structured code

## Key Accessibility Principles

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

Not everyone can use a mouse. Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated with a keyboard alone:

```jsx
// Good practice
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

// Bad practice - not keyboard accessible
<div onClick={handleClick}>Click me</div>
```

### 2. Semantic HTML

Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<!-- Good practice -->
<button>Submit</button>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<!-- Bad practice -->
<div class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</div>
<div class="nav">
  <div><a href="/">Home</a></div>
</div>
```

### 3. ARIA Attributes

When HTML semantics aren't sufficient, use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes:

```jsx
<div 
  role="button"
  aria-pressed={isActive}
  tabIndex={0}
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleClick()}
  onClick={handleClick}
>
  Toggle Feature
</div>
```

### 4. Color and Contrast

Ensure text has sufficient contrast against its background:

- Normal text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information

### 5. Alternative Text

Provide alternative text for images:

```jsx
// Informative image
<img src="chart.png" alt="Q1 sales increased by 25% compared to last year" />

// Decorative image
<img src="decoration.png" alt="" role="presentation" />
```

## Testing for Accessibility

- Use automated tools like Lighthouse, axe, or WAVE
- Test with screen readers like NVDA, VoiceOver, or JAWS
- Conduct keyboard-only navigation tests
- Review color contrast with tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker

By integrating these practices into your development workflow, you can create web applications that are truly accessible to all users.
